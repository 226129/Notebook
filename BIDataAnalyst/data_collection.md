In this document it will cover the importance of ethics in data collection. How data may be collected and common sources of freely available datasets. 

# Data ethics and privacy
Much of the data available to us comes from individuals and would be considered personally identifiable, meaning we could use it to identify someone.

Many people use the acronym PII for the term “personally identifiable information”.

Examples of PII are address, email, phone number, social security numbers, credit card numbers, and medical records. 

Ethical issues regarding data collection may be divided into the following categories. 

- **Consent**: Individuals must be informed and give their consent for imformation to be collected. 
- **Ownership**:  Anyone collecting data must be aware that individuals have ownership over their information. 
- **Intention**: Individuales must be informed about what information will be taken, how it will be stored, and how it will be used. 
- **Privacy**:: Information about individuals must be kept secure. This is specially important for any and all personally identifiable information. 


# Data collection
The first step in any data work is to collect the data itself. Data can come from a lot of places, including research, governments, technology, observation, or directly from individuals. 

We collect data in many different ways. One way is to seek out information that doesn't yet exist and measure it directly. This can include activities like surveys, observational studies, or recorgin the results of an experiment. 

Data can also be live and ever-changing based on the most-up-to-date information. For example, apps and websites can track clicks and time spent on pages across multiple users at the same time without a human actively recording all the data points. 


# Data sources 
Datasets are often kept private or can only be accessed for a fee.
