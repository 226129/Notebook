# Architectural Patterns 

## 2-Tier
Client-server is a computing model where the system is divided between two sides which are the client and the server. 

## 3-Tier 
This is the most common one, it has three layers that are used to distribute the system. The first one is the presentation tier where all the visual components and the client will interact with; the application tier that holds all the business logic and controllers and finally the data tier which is responsible of all the information from the database. 

## Peer-to-peer
Consist of a descentralized number of nodes that act as server and clients at the same time. All the nodes are connected, and its useful for collaboration.

## Event-drivem 
Focuses on producers and consumers where the producer publishes an event into a router and the router comes to n number of consumers. 

## Microservices
It breaks the system into modular components built as other services. 

# Examples 
**2-Tier**: Messaging Apps
**3-Tier**: Web Apps
**Event-driven**: Ride sharing
**Peer to peer**: Cryptocurrency
**Microservices**: Social media
