# Linux Architecture
--- 

## UI or User Interface 
Allows users to interact with the system using a keyboard or mouse. 

## The Application 
Communicate with the operating system to perform tasks. The application holds the following components: 

1. System daemons 
2. Shells 
3. User apps 
4. Tools 

## Operating System 
Is responsible for jobs that are vital for system stability such as job scheduling and keeping track of time. 

## Kernel
Is the core component of the operating system and is repsonsible for managin memory, processing and security. The kernel interacts with the hardware layer which includes all the physical or electronic devices in the computer such as processors, memory modules, input devices and storage. 

## Hardware 
As said in the kernel, the hardware is all the physical or electronic devices in the computer such as processors, memory modules, input devices and storage.
