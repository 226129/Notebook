    "# Linear Regression\n",
    "## Purpose \n",
    "Linear regression is when you have a group of points on a graph, and you find a line that approximately resembles that group of points. A good Linear Regression algorithm minimizes the error, or the distance from each point to the line. A line with the least error is the line that fits the data the best. We call this line of **best fit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formula\n",
    "In this practical case the line we will end up with will have a formula that looks like: \n",
    "\n",
    "```txt\n",
    "y = m * x + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where m is the slope of the line and b is the intercept, where the line crosses the y-axis. "
