# Adapter Pattern 
The adapter pattern works similar to a translator, when two people that speak different languages meet, they usually don't know how to communicate between them, there is where the translator comes in. 

Formally the adapter pattern is defined as allowing incompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into another expected by the clients.
