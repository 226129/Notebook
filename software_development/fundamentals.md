# What is software development? 
Software development involves various processes related to software design, development and devilery, is the set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do. 
## System software
Provide core functions such as operating system or hardware managements. 

## Application software 
Help users perform a specific task
- Ecommerces 
- Mobile applications 
- Chat applications

## Programming software 
Gives programmers the tools they need to create code
- Programming languages




# The software development process
## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
This process allows companies and developers to produce software of high quality in a timely efficient manner. 

### Requirements Gathering
Understand what is needed by the final users or stakeholders 
### Analysis 
Focusing on the apportioning of requirements to understand and document the solution 
### Design
This is the system's design where is specified how the components will work together 
### Coding 
Writing code to build the solution proposed in the design 
### Testing
Bugs or defects are found and communicated in order to be fixed. 
### Deployment
When the software is now available to the final users.
### Maintenance 
Now that the software is deployed, here the programmers make modifications or bug solving after deployed. 




# Software development roles 
## Development Team 
### Business Stakeholder 
The responsible of the project budget, direction and its ultimate success. 

### Product Manager
It works with the stakeholder to find the user's needs in order to deliver features 

### UX UI designers 
They design the software as user friendly and accessible to the final users following some standards. 

### Programmers 
#### Frontend programmer 
They handle the UI and UX interface that was designed in order to bring it to life 
#### Backend programmer
They hanlde the data processing with the databases, configurations and system's functionality
#### Full Stack Programmer
They work as the combination of a frontend and backend programmers, making them responsible to ensure both parts work well together. 

### Quality Assurance Engineer 
He is responsible to ensure that the software's behavior works as expected





# Tools for software development 
- **Whiteboards**
- **Online collaboration software**
- **Project management software**
- **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**
- **Paper and pencil**


# Getting software to customers 
## Software Deployment 
The code written is packaged, tested and released in order for the user to use it. It's highly automated where: 
- Code is written 
- Code is tested for bugs 
- Code is packaged into the existing product
- New executable is produced 
- Executable is copied to the internet

## Mobile application deployment 
- Code is packaged into the existing project 
- New executable is produced 
- New executable is given to tester 
- Tester manually checks for bugs 
- Executable is copied to app store. 



# Programming language 
A way of providing instructions to a computer in order to solve a problem or achieve a desired business goal. This programming language translate machine language (0-1) to more legible instructions.
