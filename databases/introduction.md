## What is a database? 
A database is a set of data stored in a computer. This data is usually structured in a way that makes the data easily accessible. 

## What is a Relational Database?
A relational database is a type of database. It uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database. Often, data in a relational database is organized into tables. 

## Tables: Rows and columns

Tables can also have many columns of data. Columns are labeled with a descriptive name and have a specific data type 

## What is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)? 
A relational database management system is a program that allows you to create, update, and administer a relational database. Most relational database management systems use the SQL language to access the database. 

## What is SQL? 
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to communicate with data stored in a relational database management system. SQL syntax is similar to the English language, which makes it relatively easy to write, read and interpret  

## File extensions
When working with databases, the files that we work with ends in .sqlite if you're working with SQLite, or .sql if you're working with PostgreSQL or SQL Server.
