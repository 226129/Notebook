# Malware 
Malware is malicious hardware, firmware, or software inserted into a system to cause damage or gain unauthorized access to a network. Any type of malware can greately compromise the security principles of Confidentiality, Integrity, or Availability (CIA)

## Adware 
Unwanted software designed to throw advertisements on your screen. While not overly malicious on the surface, sometimes adware can come bundled with other, more harmful malware. 

**Suggestion**: Make sure to not click on any strange links or download any untrustworthy filed. A trustworthy antivirus software could also help with this issue. 


## Virus 
Malicious self-replacing application that attaches itself to other programs and executables without the permission of the user. It's possible a downloaded virus could alter or delete data on the computer.

**Suggestion**: Just like with adware, avoid suspicious links and install trustworthy antivirus software. Report suspicious emails. 


## Worms 
Self-replicating code that copies itself from computer to computer without user intervention. This worm could be just as dangerous as a virus. It could replicate so much that it overloads a system and bringing down the availability. 

**Suggestion**: Follow the previous suggestions for adware and viruses. Monitor the computer for any unexpected changes. 


## Spyware 
Malicious code downloaded without a user's authorization which is used to steal sensitive information annd relay it to an outside party in a way that harms the original user. If the spyware contained a keylogger, a program that can record what a victim types into their computer, a threat actor could potentially gain access to sensitive information. 

**Suggestion**: Noticing a trend? Be careful on what you click on and install that trustworthy antivirus. 


# Trojan Horses 
Type of contained, non-replicating malware that disguises itself as legitimate software in order to allow scammers and hackers access to a user's system. 

**Suggestion**: Be wary of disk or computer cleaners as well as unknown antivirus software. Trojan horses often pretend to be trustworthy software in order to convince you to download them onto your machine. 


# Rootkits
These are a collection of malicious programs that secretly provide continued, privileged access to a system for an unauthorized user. A rootkit can create a backdoor on a computer to let a hacker in. 

**Suggestion**: Back up any important data on this system and reimage it. 


# Ransomware
If a malicious actor blocks access to data or theaten to publish the sensitive data unless the client pays them money, that could be a case ransomware. This is one of the largest cybersecutiry threats facing industries. 

Blocking a user's access to data greatly threatens availability. While availability might not seem important, it can be devastating to some organizations. 

**Suggestion**: Regutarly back up important files. Have a procedure in place for ransom requests. They should include a step in which the authorities are alerted.


# Fileless Malware
Type of malware that lives off the land, and uses legitimate tools and the user's operative system to perform malicious activities like privilege escalation, data collection, and more. It's increadibly hard to detect and almost always missed by antivirus software. 

It hides itself within the code of legitimate software, often altering existing code to make it malicious. 

**Suggetions**: Disable command-line applications and macros not in use on the device. Keep applications and system up to date for the latest security updates. Reboot the computer
