# Phishing
Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers disguise themselves as a trustworthy entity in electronic communications to trick individuals into providing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. This is typically done through email, social media, or other online communication methods. The goal is to deceive the recipient into believing that the message is legitimate and to take action that compromises their personal information or security.


# Types of Phishing
## Vishing 
From voice phishing, refers to the spam calls in which an attacker claims to be from a victim's bank or law enforcement and tries to extract information. 

## Smishing 
Is when an attacker attempts to do the same thing over text message, by sending a malicious link. 

## Spear phishing
Is when an attacker studies well the victim to send the malicious email that is dedicated and personalized to that person. 

## Whaling 
If the target is extremely sought after, like the CEO of a company. 


# How Does it Work? 
Sometimes phishing attacks are just emails or phone calls that attempt to get a victim to send an attacker money or payment information. Others, such as those that get people to click on links that download malware onto their systems, require more technical finesse. 

- Ember a PDF or Word document with malicious code.
- Attach it to a phishing email. 
- Social engineer a user into downloading and opening it, executing the malicious code. 


## Email Spoofing 
Email spoofing refers to when an attacker falsifies their email headers to make it appear as though the email is coming from someone else. Spoofing is a common component in phishing emails, used in as many as 90% of email fraud attacks.

In Gmail, if you open an email of interest, click on the three vertical dots in the upper right-hand corner, and click on “Show original”, you can see the email headers. 

## Webpages That Steal Passwords 
Webpages that harvest credentials are especially effective phishing tools. Because these pages often forward victims to a legitimate webpage after stealing their login information, the user never realizes they were phished. These webpages can also encourage you to download malware unknowingly.


# Detection Techniques 
## Developer tools
You can open developer tools on any buttons in an email to see where they are taking you. Developer tools is a cybersecurity expert’s best friend. It can reveal many secrets that attackers don’t want you to see.
