# Social Engineering 
Social engineering is the art of “hacking the human.” If a strong password secures a system, it is a lot faster to trick someone into giving you the password than using a password cracker. It is easy to make fun of the idea of being tricked into revealing your password. However, this sort of mocking is why social engineering is so effective. Social engineering takes advantage of the cognitive biases and social norms that we grew up with and uses those biases and norms to manipulate us. 

## Principles of Social Engineering 
### Consensus 
Consensus, also known as Social Proof, is when a social engineer convinces victims that others have already trusted them. There are many ways to apply consensus to social engineering. Some examples are fake website reviews on social media, forged work orders, using deep fake technology to impersonate someone over the phone in real-time.

### Familiarity 
Familiarity, also known as Trust, refers to a social engineer using charisma and likeability to get a victim to complete a request. Familiarity is often as simple as striking up a friendly conversation with a victim before making a request. It is often even more effective if the social engineer is, or appears to be, part of the victim’s “in-group.” 

### Urgency 
Urgency, also known as Scarcity, refers to a social engineer creating a sense of hurry to put time pressure on a victim. Creating a sense of urgency discourages the victim from thinking critically about the request while also making them feel like they are helping someone in need. Urgency is a time-honored tradition among scammers. One example is emails and robocalls informing you that your warranty is about to expire unless you ACT NOW!

### Authority 
Authority, or Intimidation, is a high-risk strategy in which a social engineer attempts to intimidate a victim or claim authority over them. While usually more subtle than “Don’t you know who I am,” Intimidation is not a subtle strategy. It has an elevated risk of the victim reporting the incident rather than complying. More practically, Authority can be combined with Consensus to create the illusion that not only is the social engineer already trusted but that they are trusted by someone with authority over the victim.
