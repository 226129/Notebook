# Social Engineering 
Social engineering is the art of “hacking the human.” If a strong password secures a system, it is a lot faster to trick someone into giving you the password than using a password cracker. It is easy to make fun of the idea of being tricked into revealing your password. However, this sort of mocking is why social engineering is so effective. Social engineering takes advantage of the cognitive biases and social norms that we grew up with and uses those biases and norms to manipulate us. 

## Principles of Social Engineering 
### Consensus 
Consensus, also known as Social Proof, is when a social engineer convinces victims that others have already trusted them. There are many ways to apply consensus to social engineering. Some examples are fake website reviews on social media, forged work orders, using deep fake technology to impersonate someone over the phone in real-time.

### Familiarity 
Familiarity, also known as Trust, refers to a social engineer using charisma and likeability to get a victim to complete a request. Familiarity is often as simple as striking up a friendly conversation with a victim before making a request. It is often even more effective if the social engineer is, or appears to be, part of the victim’s “in-group.” 

### Urgency 
Urgency, also known as Scarcity, refers to a social engineer creating a sense of hurry to put time pressure on a victim. Creating a sense of urgency discourages the victim from thinking critically about the request while also making them feel like they are helping someone in need. Urgency is a time-honored tradition among scammers. One example is emails and robocalls informing you that your warranty is about to expire unless you ACT NOW!

### Authority 
Authority, or Intimidation, is a high-risk strategy in which a social engineer attempts to intimidate a victim or claim authority over them. While usually more subtle than “Don’t you know who I am,” Intimidation is not a subtle strategy. It has an elevated risk of the victim reporting the incident rather than complying. More practically, Authority can be combined with Consensus to create the illusion that not only is the social engineer already trusted but that they are trusted by someone with authority over the victim.


# Social Engineering with Emails 
Sending unsolicited emails, also known as spam, is a highly effective social engineering strategy. Most spam emails that show up in our inboxes are obviously fake, and this is deliberate: The scammers who send these emails want easy victims who won’t realize they’re being scammed. Sure, fewer people will open the email, but those who do open it are more likely to be tricked.

**Prepending** involves altering the subject line, or attaching a message to the email, that says something like “RE:” or “MAILSAFE:PASSED”, in order to make it appear that:

- We have already been communicating with the sender, OR
- The email has passed a spam filter.


# Hoaxes 
Lying to get what you want is a core part of social engineering, and this can come in many forms. Often, it aligns with one or more of the core principles of social engineering. In social engineering, these lies are often called **hoaxes**. One common hoax is to fake security alerts, creating a sense of urgency for the victim. These fake alerts often make use of trust and authority as well, because the alerts appear to come from real sources which instruct the victim to take the required action.

Another type of lie used in social engineering is **pretexting**, which is when a social engineer invents a false **pretext**, or reason, for why a victim should share information or carry out an action. 


# Social Engineering and URLs
A strategy known as **pharming** refers to when a social engineer redirects victims from a legimitate website to their malicious website instead. This generally involves tamppering with DNS information for a computer, a network, or a larger portion of the internet. 

**Typosquatting** is when an attacker will register a domain very similar to an existing legitimate website, then wait to people to visit the malicious domain. 

## Commong URLs Techniques 
1. Change a letter 
2. Remove a letter
3. Add a letter 
4. Use a different domain that appears legitimate 
5. Use special characters that are visually indistiguishable


# Identity Fraud
**Identity fraud** refers to when an attacker uses a victim’s personal information. Many of us have heard of examples of malicious actors pretending to be someone for financial gain. For example, using someone else’s credit card or bank account.

On an individual scale, this could be something like using stolen personal information to “recover” a bank account or target an organization that the individual works for. 


# Credential Harvesting 
Credential harvesting is when an attacker obtains, or harvests, a victim's credentials. This can be targeted at a specific user, as part of a multi-stage attack, but credentials are often stolen from many users at once, usually for financial gain. 

One method of targeted credential harvesting is known as a watering hole attack. This is when an attacker compromises a third-party service, software, or wesite used by a target in order to get access to the target. 


# Physical Social Engineering Strategies 
Having physical access to a target opens a world of new possibilities for an attacker, and sometimes obtaining physical access can be easier than breaking in using technology. 

**Tailgating** refers to the act of following someone through a secure door before that door can close. 

**Dumpster diving** is the process of going through trash to obtain sensitive information. 

**Shoulder surfing** refers to the act of looking over someone's shoulder as they type their password.
