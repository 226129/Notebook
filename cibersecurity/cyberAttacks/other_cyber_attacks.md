# Supply Chain Attacks 
In Cybersecurity, there is a concept known as pivoting, where an attacker will compromise one computer, then use that computer to compromise another computer. Supply chain attacks are the same idea, but with organizations instead of single computers.

For example, suppose we’re targeting a defense contractor to steal their secret documents. The defense contractor probably has good security, as mandated by their contract with the government. However, we happen to know that the contractor uses a piece of commercial software developed by a different company with weaker security. By hacking the software company, we could inject malware into the software they develop that gives us a backdoor into the computers it is installed on. When the defense contractor next updates their software, we now have access to their computers.

# Adversarial AI attacks 
## AI and cybersecurity 
AI is a very useful tool for cybersecurity, especially when trying to secure large or complicated environments. AI can be used to help identify abnormal or suspicious behavior, and report it to analysts who can investigate further.

However, like many cybersecurity tools, AI can also be used for more nefarious purposes, such as identifying vulnerabilities and methods of circumventing security. This is known as adversarial AI.

## Machine learning
Some types of machine learning allow us to create algorithms that cannot practically be manually programmed. However, these algorithms have a downside: We don’t really understand how they make decisions. For example, if we train an algorithm to tell whether or not a picture is a cat or a dog, it’s very difficult to determine the algorithm’s “thought process”, even if its decisions are accurate.
