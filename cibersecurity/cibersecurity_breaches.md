# Impacts of Cybersecurity Breaches 
When cibersecurity falls short, breaches happen. 

## Breaches, exfiltration, and data loss 
The terms **Data Breach**, **Data Exfiltration**, and **Data Loss** sound similar and are often used interchangeably outside of Cybersecurity. Within Cybersecurity, there are some important distinctions between the three terms:

- A **Data breach** refers to any unauthorized access to data, intentionally or accidentally. 
- A **Data exfiltration** refers to the intentional and unauthorized transfer of data to an external source. 
- A **Data loss** is when data becomes unavailable, either temporarily or permanently. 

Data exfiltration can be considered a type of data breach. Data loss can sometimes result from breaches, but it can also occur on its own for other reasons.

# Prevention and response 
 Even if an organization does everything right, itâ€™s still possible for them to suffer a data breach if previously-unknown vulnerabilities are exploited.

 Security professionals need to take a holistic approach to security in order to prevent incidents as well as be ready to perform incident response when incidents do occur. By learning from the incidents that occur, we can more effectively protect against future incidents.
